#TASK DESCRIPTION

üìÑ Task Description: Personal Developer Portfolio Webpage
The objective of this task is to design and develop a responsive single-page personal portfolio website using fundamental web development technologies‚ÄîHTML and CSS. This portfolio webpage will serve as a central hub for showcasing a developer's personal information, professional projects, and contact details. It is intended to be simple yet professional, allowing visitors to quickly understand who the developer is, what they‚Äôve worked on, and how they can be reached.

This task helps build an essential piece of any developer‚Äôs online presence: their portfolio site. A well-structured portfolio not only reflects technical skills in front-end development, but also serves as a live example of a developer's coding style, attention to design, and user experience practices. The deliverable will be a responsive, single-page web application with clear navigation links to the main sections: About, Projects, and Contact.

üîß Technical Requirements
You are to use only HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for this project. These technologies should be used to:

Structure the content of the portfolio site (with HTML).

Style and enhance the visual appearance and layout (with CSS).

Ensure responsiveness, so the site looks good and functions well on a variety of screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

No JavaScript, frameworks, or external libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS should be used for this task, in order to strengthen your pure HTML/CSS skills.

üìå Required Sections
The webpage should include the following clearly defined and styled sections:

Navigation Bar:

A fixed or static top navigation bar with links that scroll to different sections of the page.

Links to ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù, ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù, and ‚ÄúContact‚Äù sections.

Should collapse or stack vertically on smaller screens using responsive design techniques.

About Section:

A personal introduction: name, short bio, and role (e.g., "Frontend Developer").

A few sentences describing your skills, interests, or technologies you're familiar with.

Clean layout, centered text or simple grid-based design.

Projects Section:

A heading (e.g., ‚ÄúMy Projects‚Äù) and at least 2‚Äì3 sample project entries.

Each project entry should include a title, short description, and optionally, a link or image preview.

Use of CSS to lay out projects in cards, columns, or a flexible grid that adjusts to screen size.

Contact Section:

Information for getting in touch: email address, LinkedIn profile, or other preferred methods.

Clean layout with good spacing and visual hierarchy.

Optionally, include a simple contact form layout (though functionality is not required).

Footer:

A small footer with copyright information.

Consistent styling with the rest of the page.

üì± Responsiveness
A major requirement is that the portfolio site must be responsive. This means it should:

Display correctly on different screen sizes using media queries.

Adjust font sizes, layout widths, and navigation structure for mobile viewing.

Use flexible CSS properties (like flexbox or grid) to adapt content layout.

üß† Learning Objectives
By completing this task, you will:

Practice semantic HTML5 and clean code structure.

Understand CSS layout models (Flexbox/Grid).

Learn how to design a responsive UI using media queries.

Gain insight into structuring a developer portfolio that reflects personal brand and skills.

‚úÖ Deliverable
A complete single HTML file (index.html) and CSS file (style.css) that together form a responsive, scrollable, one-page personal portfolio website. The code should be clean, well-indented, and organized for maintainability.

Optional additions may include:

Project thumbnails or images

Smooth scroll behavior with CSS

Hover effects for interactivity
